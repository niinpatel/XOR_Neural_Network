# XOR_Neural_Network

This repo (and the previous one layer perceptron implementation), is a follow along of Daniel Shiffman's [Intro to Machine Learning course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIa0-ZKCrc&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bCN8LKrcMa6zF4FPtXyXYj)

This is my first ever attempt at programming and and trying to understand neural networks. I still don't completely understand the maths though, yet.
